      <p>I don't know if you're going to open this again after seeing it once. I know nagaway nanaman tayo. kind of hurts but strangely I want to fight for us even more. I'm afraid na if i get work yung pagaaway nten will be more frequent that's why if you ever read this i'm begging and asking for a bit more understanding. Uu nasasaktan ako pero this time i want to fight for it more. Ikaw na talaga hehe. One day I do hope to shatter that wall you created I'm Optimistic you'll lower your guard for me for me to see your soft/sweet side. I Love youuuu. updated : 2/9/2026</p>

      <p>Just woke up this afternoon, sama paden ng pakiramdam ko and I'm Thankful you still replied to me. idk if galit ka or what but i'm relieved na you're here. Still unwell but i want to at least see your face. My heart is longing to see you. I missed you so much. I do hope wala na tayong away in the future. I do hope you overcome na yung tampo tampo. i Hope balang araw masaya nalang tayo. update: 2/10/2026</p>
