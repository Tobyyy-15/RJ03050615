      <p>I don't know if you're going to open this again after seeing it once. I know nagaway nanaman tayo. kind of hurts but strangely I want to fight for us even more. I'm afraid na if i get work yung pagaaway nten will be more frequent that's why if you ever read this i'm begging and asking for a bit more understanding. Uu nasasaktan ako pero this time i want to fight for it more. Ikaw na talaga hehe. One day I do hope to shatter that wall you created I'm Optimistic you'll lower your guard for me for me to see your soft/sweet side. I Love youuuu. updated : 2/9/2026</p>

      <p>Ang bigat lang talaga sa dibdib. I really thought this time magiging mas maayos na tayo. I held on to your promise and believed that things would be different. Kaya nung parang bumalik ulit sa dati, sobrang sakit para sakin.
When you said you would try, I trusted that you meant it. Hindi naman ako naghahanap ng perfection, gusto ko lang maramdaman na we’re both really choosing each other even when it’s hard. Kasi para sakin, yung promise is something we hold on to especially during tampo, not something we let go of.Nung ikaw yung nag reach out ulit, naniwala ako na maybe this time kaya na natin. I wanted to believe in us again. I still do. Nasasaktan lang ako kasi I was hoping for change, hoping that we would both fight for something better this time.</p>

      <p>Masakit para sakin kapag may mga bagay na ina-assume o ina-accuse ako kahit wala naman akong ginawa. If I ever made a mistake before, I would understand. But you know I’ve never cheated or betrayed you. That’s why it hurts when I’m made to feel like I did.</p>
<p>I chose to forgive the past because I wanted us to move forward happily. I didn’t want to keep bringing up old wounds. I just hoped that we could both help each other heal instead of reopening them. Sometimes I feel like even after giving my effort and my trust, I’m still being doubted and that’s what really hurts.</p>
<p>I don’t want chaos. I don’t want fights. What I want is peace, understanding, and a more mature kind of love. I try my best to care for you, to treat you gently, to make you feel loved. I just wish we could choose calm over conflict, and work things out without hurting each other.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I feel like my feelings aren’t fully understood. When I say I’m hurt, I’m not trying to fight—I just want us to understand each other better.
I was really looking forward to the outing, so it hurt when things turned that way. I try my best to love you the right way, and I hope you can see that in everything I do.
I know you say it’s just “tampo,” and maybe for you it feels small. But when I’m the one trying to fix things, especially when it takes hours, my heart feels heavy and uneasy. I just want you to understand that during those moments, I’m hurting too.</p>
