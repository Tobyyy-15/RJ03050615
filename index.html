      <p>I don't know if you're going to open this again after seeing it once. I know nagaway nanaman tayo. kind of hurts but strangely I want to fight for us even more. I'm afraid na if i get work yung pagaaway nten will be more frequent that's why if you ever read this i'm begging and asking for a bit more understanding. Uu nasasaktan ako pero this time i want to fight for it more. Ikaw na talaga hehe. One day I do hope to shatter that wall you created I'm Optimistic you'll lower your guard for me for me to see your soft/sweet side. I Love youuuu. updated : 2/9/2026</p>

      <p>Just woke up this afternoon, sama paden ng pakiramdam ko and I'm Thankful you still replied to me. idk if galit ka or what but i'm relieved na you're here. Still unwell but i want to at least see your face. My heart is longing to see you. I missed you so much. I do hope wala na tayong away in the future. I do hope you overcome na yung tampo tampo. i Hope balang araw masaya nalang tayo. update: 2/10/2026</p>

       <p>heavy. so heavy.I thought na we'll be better na this time around. pero nung day 1 lang pala. the same day you promised the same day you broke that promise and went back on your words kasi nagtatampo ka. are promises that meaningless to you? na you'll just went back and say " di ko pa pala kaya" kaya ka nga nagpromise eh para kayanin mo. for you to push for it. you haven't changed. you cannot keep your words. you're still treating me unfair. when you reached out to me again i thought you've changed and i thought na maybe this time we can na. </p>

       <p>pero everytime na nagagalit ka lahat ng effort and mabubuting ginawa ko gets thrown out of the window. lahat yun parang walang nangyare and even though wala akong ginawang masama magagalit ka and ipupush mo na galit mo. just like nakaraan nagalit ka kasi they gossip sa office about me. even though you know na i'm not involved antagal ko na wala sa office pero you kept on pushing pden yung issue . i even told you na let's drop the topic kasi wala syang benefit saten. let's just keep being happy and positive. di ko alam goal eh para pagusapan yun di ka naniniwala saken mas naniniwala ka pa sa gossips. you never put your trust on me kahit na i never did anything wrong to you not even once while i put my trust in you kahit na andaming beses mo na nagsinungaling sa akin.

       <p>yun pa yung masakit eh. kung ano anong inaaccuse mo sakin . matatanggap ko sana kung may nagawa talaga ako dati na panloloko sayo or nagcheat ako pero hindi eh. never kong ginawa sayo yun. actually it was you who lied to me pa nga and sasabihin mo nnmn na brinibringup ko? ehh eto ikaw kahit hindi ko ginawa inaacuse mo ko. i forgave you na eh and you're supposed to make me forget about it by us just being happy. pero hindi eh you're reminding me pa on how you treat me. it hurts. it hurts na i'm the one who got lied to despite that i gave you effort and in exchange i get to be treated like this. i'm sorry di ko na kaya itake yung ugali mo Julie. from what i see you're longing for chaos. i wanted peace i'm sorry. you haven't own to any accountability yet always throwing tantrums to avoid one. i was hoping for a matured relationship. binababy naman kita even wala ung mga tampo tampo. i'm treating you like a princess naman. why do you always need to add chaos. bakit need ng gulo?   </p>

      <p>you always invalidate my feelings. you reacts on my reaction to your action and not fix why i'm hurting. kapag sinabi ko nasasaktan ako magagalit ka sakin imbis na tulungan mo ako </p>
       <p> i was looking forward pa naman sana sa outing pero di ko deserve na ganito ako itrato eh. mabait akong tao. Idk why is it needed to have this tampo for me to prove i love you. di pa ba evident sa lahat ng ginawa and gagawin ko pa?</p>
      <p>easy for you to say na "tampo lang" di kasi ikaw yung nanunuyo. haven't you notice na halos araw araw and most of it 3-5 hours tinatagal. you might not notice. and those hours i'm uneasy , my heart aches. it hurts. easy for you to say kasi di mo pa ko sinuyo because i never let you do anything like that. i don't want to make it difficult for you</p>
        <p>i'm sorry julieta. sobrang naibuhos ko na sarili ko. i cannot continue anymore. ubos na ko.I'm done crying. I'm so sorry</p>

       <p>Last night I decided to finally end it. I would love for this to continue but i cannot see the future if were like this. When you want to start a family you need someone mature.   </p>
      <p>Until last night signs of manipulation is here and there. all sorry are directed outwards feels like it's really wasn't an apology but a words thrown to make someone feel bad. idk if you learned that with Jolo pero it's not how it's properly done eh.</p>

      <p>Everytime i'm voicing out something you always think it's offensive. you always make it like I said something rude to you. idk  you don't want to recognize things. simply you don't want to change. this is why i made this decision. it was really hard pero it's what we both need. you said you were trying, i just can't feel it. every conversation turns negative every simple things turns to conflict. It's tiring. </p>

I'm letting go kahit na mahirap saken kase in my heart i know mahal na mahal pden kita. pero if we continue masasaktan lang tayo pareho sa dulo.
